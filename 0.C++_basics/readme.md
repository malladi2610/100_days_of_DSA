1. For the print hello world program
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-cout-and-stdcout-in-c/
- Why is std :: used in C++?
The string and vector which we want to use are in the C++ standard library, so they belong to the std namespace. This is why you need to add std:: to them. It is the same reason to use std:: for cout and cin 

2. For the quadratic roots finding problem:
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-does-hashinclude-bits-stdcplusplus-h-work-in-cplusplus
- What does the library <bits/stdc++.h> do?
The <bits/stdc++.h> is a header file. This file includes all standard library. Sometimes in some coding contests, when we have to save time while solving, then using this header file is helpful.
